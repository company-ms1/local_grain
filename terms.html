<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Last updated: <strong>August 2025</strong></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to <strong>RentTRX</strong>. By accessing or using our TRON Energy rental service, you agree to these Terms of Service.</p>

<h2>2. Service Description</h2>
<p>We provide temporary delegation of TRON Energy in exchange for TRX payment. Once delivered, the Energy is available for the stated rental period and cannot be recalled early.</p>

<h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
<li>You must provide the correct TRON wallet address for energy delivery.</li>
<li>You are responsible for ensuring your wallet is able to receive Energy.</li>
<li>You must not use the Energy for illegal purposes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Payments</h2>
<p>All payments are made in TRX via the TRON blockchain. Prices are clearly stated before purchase. Due to blockchain's irreversible nature, payments are non-refundable except in rare cases defined in our <a href="/refund.html">Refund Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>5. Disclaimer</h2>
<p>We are not responsible for any loss of funds, missed transactions, or other damages caused by misuse, network delays, or technical issues outside our control.</p>
